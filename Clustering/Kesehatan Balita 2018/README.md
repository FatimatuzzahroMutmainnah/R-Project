## Klaster Kesehatan Balita Tahun 2018 (Clustering of Toddler Health in Indonesia in 2018)

### Overview

<p align="left">This project focused on clustering analysis using R. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points based on their characteristics. This project demonstrates the use of various clustering algorithms and techniques to explore and analyze the data.</p>

### Project Structure

<p align="left">
  - ðŸ“‘ <strong>Data:</strong> The dataset used for this analysis is Data Kesehatan Balita (Toddler Health Data), which includes 4 variables from 34 data (province)<br>
  - âš¡<strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Standardization<br>
  - ðŸ“Š <strong>Data visualization:</strong> Boxplot of each variable<br>
  - ðŸ”Ž <strong>Clustering Methods:</strong> This project showcases the application of clustering techniques such as Hierarchical Clustering, which organizes data into a tree-like structure based on distances between points, and K-Means Clustering, which partitions the data into a set number of clusters to minimize within-cluster variance.<br>
  - ðŸ“‹ <strong>Evaluation:</strong> ICD-Rate and Pseudo F</p>

### Getting Started

<p align="left">
  - <strong>Requirements:</strong> Ensure that R and the necessary packages are installed. You can install the required packages using the following command:<br>

  ```
install.packages(c("readxl", "car", "dplyr", "factoextra", "cluster", "stats"))
```
  - <strong>Running the Analysis:</strong> To reproduce the analysis, run the scripts in the order specified in the project structure section.</p>

### Conclusion

<p align="left">This project provides an introduction to clustering techniques in R and demonstrates how to apply them to real-world data. The clustering methods explored offer different perspectives on the data, and each has its strengths and limitations.</p>

### Future Work
